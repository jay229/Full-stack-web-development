              Iron Man is a fictional superhero appearing in American comic
              books published by Marvel Comics. The character was co-created by
              writer and editor Stan Lee, developed by scripter Larry Lieber,
              and designed by artists Don Heck and Jack Kirby. The character
              made his first appearance in Tales of Suspense #39 (cover dated
              March 1963), and received his own title in Iron Man #1 (May 1968).
              A wealthy American business magnate, playboy, and ingenious
              scientist, Anthony Edward "Tony" Stark suffers a severe chest
              injury during a kidnapping. When his captors attempt to force him
              to build a weapon of mass destruction, he instead creates a
              mechanized suit of armor to save his life and escape captivity.
              Later, Stark develops his suit, adding weapons and other
              technological devices he designed through his company, Stark
              Industries. He uses the suit and successive versions to protect
              the world as Iron Man. Although at first concealing his true
              identity, Stark eventually publicly reveals himself to be Iron
              Man.
